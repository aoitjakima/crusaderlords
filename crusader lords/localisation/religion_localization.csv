terrorian_DESC;Terrorians worship the Greater Daemon the Writhing Terror, the most powerful of all daemons known to mankind, the Terror fought with the Insidious Wrath during the collapse of Casia, the Terror managed to stop the growth of the mana wastes just outside the Avasian barrier mountains.

No Magic not of the Terror, no worship of other gods, consumption of flesh is holy. The Terror is the most familiar with mankind and as such his blessings do not deprive humans of their form.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
