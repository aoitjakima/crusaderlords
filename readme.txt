		documents/paradox interactive/crusader kings II/mod
	Copy Map and CK2Tools-v19 directory to another directory
	
2. Start up CK2 and make sure that you load just the mod and your DLC to make sure it boots.

3. Take a sub-culture, open the provincesDef.xls in map and remove all the lines except the ones with your selected culture column 'k'

4. Create logical dutchies roughly 3.5 counties in size (Make one duchy 3 and another one 4)
	Decide the borders of the dutchy based on the counties in the game
	copy the name of the dutchy into column J

5. Create holding names
	fill in columns P-V with the holding names
	in column P suffix the name of the holding with (U)
		example: bortford(U)
		
6. Save off changes as 'provenceDef - <3 letter culture abriviation>'
